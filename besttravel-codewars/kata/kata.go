John and Mary want to travel between a few towns A, B, C ... Mary has on a sheet of paper a list of distances between
these towns. ls = [50, 55, 57, 58, 60]. John is tired of driving, and he says to Mary that he doesn't want to drive more
than t = 174 miles, and he will visit only k = 3 towns.

Which distances, hence which towns, they will choose so that the sum of the distances is the biggest possible to please
Mary and John?
